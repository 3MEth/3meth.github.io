  <h2>User Behavior Prediction</h2>
  <p><strong>Task Definition:</strong> Predict which users will buy or sell tokens and which tokens they are likely to transact with at a future time.</p>
  <p><strong>Baseline Models:</strong> Six dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) were evaluated for this task: DyGFormer, JODIE, DyRep, TGAT, TGN, and TCL.</p>
  <p><strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> The task was evaluated using two metrics: Test Set Average Precision (TAP) and New Node Average Precision (NAP).</p>
  <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>JODIE performed best, achieving a TAP of 0.955 and NAP of 0.920 when incorporating sentiment data from large language models (LLMs).</li>
    <li>DyGFormer also performed well, reaching TAP of 0.939 and NAP of 0.905 using global market indices and sentiment scores.</li>
    <li>TCL showed weaker performance, especially on sentiment-based models, with a TAP of 0.750 on the combined features (token data, global market, sentiment).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Incorporating sentiment and global market features significantly improved prediction accuracy across the models, particularly for JODIE and DyGFormer.</p>
</div>

<div class="task-section">
  <h2>Token Price Prediction</h2>
  <p><strong>Task Definition:</strong> Forecast the future price of tokens using historical price data, global market indices, and sentiment analysis.</p>
  <p><strong>Baseline Models:</strong> Two recurrent models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), were used for evaluation.</p>
  <p><strong>Performance Metric:</strong> The models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).</p>
  <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>LSTM consistently outperformed GRU, particularly when incorporating additional features like sentiment and global indices.</li>
    <li>The best LSTM model achieved an MSE of 1.667 when using a combination of price, global market data, and sentiment, compared to an MSE of 2.271 for GRU.</li>
    <li>For newly issued tokens (with limited historical data), incorporating sentiment reduced the error further. For instance, MSE dropped from 0.532 to 0.511 when sentiment features were added.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> LSTM was more effective at price prediction, especially when using multimodal inputs (price, sentiment, market indices).</p>
</div>

<div class="task-section">
  <h2>User Behavior Marking</h2>
  <p><strong>Task Definition:</strong> Assign a risk score to a user's trading behavior by analyzing price fluctuations of tokens they buy and sell.</p>
  <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> The risk score is calculated based on traditional financial models, using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and variance in token prices during the userâ€™s investment period.</p>
  <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>TokenInsight Rating Evaluation: Tokens with higher ratings (e.g., AAA) showed lower average risk scores, while those with lower ratings (e.g., CCC or D) had higher risk scores.</li>
    <li>Time Period Evaluation: Longer investment periods generally resulted in lower risk, validating that short-term trading carried higher risks.</li>
    <li>During the LUNA crash event, the average risk score increased dramatically (from 21.35 million before the incident to 24.66 million during the crash), indicating heightened market volatility and risk.</li>
